# R-Custom-Function
Custom built functions

## ZWins.r
This function use below custom logic to winsorize data (up to 100 iterations)

Parameters:

  data     - vector raw data
  sigCheck - used to check whether Z Score of raw data is out side of this check threshold;
  sigAdj   - used to adjust outliers

Algorithm:	
	1. Set Iteration =1;
	2. Compute z-scores (cross-sectional) for all the raw ratios in the base universe selected
	    If All |z-score| < 5, use this z-score as the final result. Stop iterative process.
	    If Any |z-score| >= 5, then flag any instance that has a z-score > |3| as outlierÂ 
	3. Compute a new_mean and new_stdev of raw ratios from #1 that are not flagged as outliers (having a z-score with z-scores <= |3|)
	4. For any raw ratios that,
	    raw ratios > (new_mean + 3*new_stdev), then replace it with new_mean + 3*new_stdev
      raw ratios < (new_mean - 3*new_stdev), then replace it with new_mean - 3*new_stdev
	5. Iteration = Iteration + 1;
	6. Repeat steps 2 to 5. End process at 2.1 or until Iteration = 4, whichever is earliest.
